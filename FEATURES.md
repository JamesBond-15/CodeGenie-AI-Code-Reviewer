#  CodeGenie Features

CodeGenie is designed as a mentor-style AI system that helps users understand, improve, and grow their Python coding skills through natural language feedback and adaptive review styles.

---

##  Code Explanation
Users can paste Python code and receive a clear, step-by-step natural language explanation of what the code does.

This feature helps:
- Beginners understand syntax and logic  
- Learners visualize program flow  
- Developers quickly interpret unfamiliar code  

---

##  AI-Based Code Review
CodeGenie reviews Python code and provides:
- Optimized AI-generated alternatives  
- Side-by-side comparison with original code  
- Clear reasoning for each suggested change  
- Best practice recommendations  

This makes improvement **visible, not abstract**.

##  Tone-Based Review System
Users can choose how they want feedback to be delivered:

| Tone            | Behavior                                   |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Gentle Mentor** | Friendly, beginner-oriented guidance       |
| **Zen Master**    | Balanced, thoughtful, and calm feedback    |
| **Brutal Senior** | Direct, professional, and critical review  |

Each tone modifies the style and strictness of the feedback.
